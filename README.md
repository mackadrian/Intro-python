# Intro-python
This repository contains the Python projects that were created through YouTube tutorials.

These projects were not created from scratch, but rather used Youtube tutorials to do a 
step-by-step shadowing of how a program functions. The goal for these projects was to 
gain a greater understanding of what someone would do in the fields of Computer Science.
During my first year, most of the concepts were theory-based and fundamentals and foundations
of programming. In this case, these projects would perhaps help establish the applications of programming.
